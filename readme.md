# ðŸŒµ Cactu framework for Discord.js
`npm i cactu-discord.js`

All things which was here was deprecated.
Github Wiki is also deprecated. All information need to be rewrited to v3.x.x

If anybody will be interested in use it, tell me that.
I can update the docs and the code of the bot.

## TODO
 * real modularized system (currently only 1 file can be loaded)
 * prefix information passed by modules, not in bot instance
 * find all vulnerabilities
 * predefined option to add or delete commands and filters
