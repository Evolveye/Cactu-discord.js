# ðŸŒµ Cactu framework for Discord.js
`npm i cactu-discord.js`  
Examples and configuration description on [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/PawelekS/Cactu-discord.js/wiki)

Cactu projects are using an `import {} export ""` instead of the `require()`, so you have to use `--experimental-modules` node.js flag, and `.mjs` instead of `js` files extensions or `"type": "module"` field in package.json

Look into `example_config/` folder for *example config*
